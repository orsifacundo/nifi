#Apache NiFi

##Introduction

For a quick introduction on Apache NiFi you can read the [this article](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/nifi-surf-on-your-dataflow-4f3343c50aa2/).

##Repo structure

This repository contains 2 folders: one with some **templates** that I find very useful to get to know how some things can be achieved and the other with **examples** that I've made.

##Development

###JSON_conversions

This dataflow shows how to manage JSON objects (in this example a generated response from a REST API) and convert them into some other formats.
It selects some fields and builds:

- One CSV with all the information
- Multiple CSVs each with a piece of information
- Multiple JSONs each with a piece of information
